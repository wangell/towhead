Tag-based file system organization using links

Impetus:  I needed to tag images/songs/etc. with multiple tags and still have it work with existing software.

Plans for the future:

-Telescoping folder structures based on input patterns: (blah, blah2 -> (blah3, blah4)) produces a folder structure with blah1/blah2 located in the root directory, and blah3/4 as sub-directories of blah2.

-Saving of space patterns (aliases for tree-structures/tags)
